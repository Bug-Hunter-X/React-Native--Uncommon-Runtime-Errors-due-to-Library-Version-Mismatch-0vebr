To fix this, you need to ensure that all the libraries you are using are compatible with each other and with your current version of React Native.  Check the library's documentation to see which versions of React Native it supports.  You can use the `npm ls` or `yarn why` command to find out which versions of libraries are installed and which library depends on which other libraries. Use `npm install --save <library>` or `yarn add <library>` to install the correct library.  Also, use version ranges for better management and to accommodate future updates. Consider using a package manager like yarn or npm to install and manage your dependencies.  For example, in your package.json, you might specify a version range like `"react-native-library": "^1.0.0"` to allow for minor updates. Always test thoroughly after resolving any dependency issues.
