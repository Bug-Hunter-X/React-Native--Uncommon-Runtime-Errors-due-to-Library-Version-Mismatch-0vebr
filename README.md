This repository demonstrates a common yet often overlooked issue in React Native development: runtime errors stemming from library version mismatches or incompatibilities. The `Bug.js` file showcases a scenario where using an incompatible library causes unexpected behavior, resulting in runtime errors.  The `BugSolution.js` file provides a solution by carefully reviewing and managing the project's dependencies and ensuring compatibility.  This is vital for stable and efficient React Native applications.   The example uses a hypothetical library to illustrate the problem but the principle applies to many real-world situations.
